justic - just static
====================
Let me explain what was inside my head as I start this:

There are a bunch of templates that defined some basic views, like a list-view,
a card-view or some grid-view. And the content files will be in another folder.
Every file contains some data and define the template for the render. The
structure of the files will be the structure of the output html files.
